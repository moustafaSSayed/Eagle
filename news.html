     <h1>Coronavirus Tips If You Still Have to Travel Domestically</h1>
     <h4>21 JULY 2020</h4>
     <hr>
     <hr>
     <img src="img/woman-airport-coronavirus-mask-suitcase_contributer_use-1400x500.jpg">
     <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has largely put an end to travel,
        but there are still people needing to fly to provide care for others or
         travel for essential work service. Traveling feels scary right now,
          especially for those who can’t drive to their destination, but there are
           ways to make the journey as safe as possible for yourself and others.<br>
            So if you have to board a plane right now, here are the coronavirus tips you
             need to know for domestic travel.</p>
             <h1>Avoid Public Transportation</h1>
                     <p>The goal when traveling during the coronavirus crisis it to avoid as
                          many people as possible, so steer clear of any public transportation if you can.
                           Either take your own car to the airport, have someone you’ve been quarantining
                            with drive you, or take a car service/taxi. If you’re taking public transportation
                             of any kind, wear a mask and be mindful to touch as few surfaces as possible.</p>
                             
        <h1>Wear a Face Mask or Cloth Covering</h1>
        <p> Even if you aren’t showing symptoms,
          there’s a chance you may have contracted the virus.
           To protect others, the CDC recommends that people wear
            a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth when out in public.
             While stores are largely out of masks, you can create your own using a towel,
              bandanna, scarf, or t-shirt. The CDC offers a guide on how to make your own.
               Note that coverings should not be placed on children under two years of age or anyone
                who has trouble breathing. Once it’s on, 
         don’t touch it without washing your hands first.</p>

                    “The reopening of borders will be done in a phased manner,
                     with nationals allowed to return home from July 15 in phase one for travel by air [via] Douglas Charles and Canefield Airport,”

            <h1>India to reopen Taj Mahal with social distancing, masks</h1>

            <img src="img/Taj-Mahal-Agra-India.jpg">
            <p>NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Visitors to the Taj Mahal will have to wear masks at all times,
                keep their distance,<br> and not touch its glistening marble surfaces when India’s 17th-century
                 monument to love reopens on Monday after a three-month COVID-19 shutdown.</p>
            <p>Only 5,000 tourists will be allowed in a day, split into two groups, a far cry from
            peak levels of 80,000<br> a day who would swarm the mausoleum built in the northern city
             of Agra by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his wife, in a 22-year effort.</p>
             <p>“All centrally protected monuments & sites shall be bound by the protocols like sanitization,
                  social distancing & other health protocols,” the federal tourism ministry said in a tweet.
                   Authorities are reopening the Taj and other monuments, such as New Delhi’s historic Red Fort,
                    just as India’s coronavirus infections are rising at the fastest pace in three months. On Sunday
                    , the health ministry reported a record single-day spike of 24,850 new cases and more than 600 deaths,
                  pushing the overall case tally to 673,165, closing in on Russia, the third-most affected country globally.</p>

                <p>Taiwan's a transportation and health ministers removed a face mask
                    from a sand sculpture at a ceremony in Taipei to kickstart
                     a domestic tourism initiative.</p>
                     <p>The government has allocated $130 million

                            and its infection rate is one of the lowest in the world with less than 500 cases
                             and just seven deaths.</p>
            <p>However, Chen Shih-Chung, Taiwan's Minister of Health and Welfare said:
