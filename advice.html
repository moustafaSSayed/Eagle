                <h1 class="entry-title">Travel Tips</h1>
                <h2 class="h2">Travel Tips For Flying</h2>
                <h3 class="h3">Follow The Business Travelers</h3>
                <p class="p">1: Hate long security lines at the airport? Try to get in line behind business travelers, because they travel often and will know what they’re doing. Stay away from families, because they take forever to unpack and get through security.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Stay Hydrated</h3>
                <p class="p">2: The recirculated air in planes is super dry, and sitting there for hours can dry out your body quickly. Most people don’t drink enough water anyway, and flying makes it even worse. This contributes to jet lag too.</p>

                <p class="p">Before getting on an airplane I recommend you pre-hydrate by drinking a liter of water mixed with some re-hydration salts. Just don’t use you water filter with these, or it will get clogged!</p>
                <h2 class="h2">Travel Planning Tips</h2>
                <h3 class="h3">Learn A Few Foreign Words</h3>
                <p class="p">3: There’s no need to be fluent in order to visit a foreign country. Not being able to communicate while traveling can be frustrating, but remember that this is your problem, not theirs. Raising your voice doesn’t magically help Mexican’s understand English. Try hand signals, images on your phone, or Google Translate!</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Take An Extra Credit & ATM Card</h3>
                <p class="p">4: Having your bank card details stolen can suck, but especially if it happens when you’re visiting a foreign country. If your card gets frozen, stolen, or the ATM machine eats it, you’re screwed! Unless you happen to carry backup cards…</p>
                <p class="p">An important travel tip is to pack a 2nd bank account/debit card plus a backup credit card, which you keep separate from your wallet. This way, if your wallet gets stolen, or your ATM card gets declined, you are still able to have access to money during your travels.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Write Down The Address Of Your Hotel</h3>
                <p class="p">5: Sometimes, after a long flight playing games on your smartphone, your battery could end up dead. And if you didn’t write down the address of where you’re staying, how will you tell/show the taxi driver?</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Read A Book About The Country</h3>
                <p class="p">6: Before you travel to a new country, I recommend reading a good book about it, to learn more about history and culture before you arrive. This could be as simple as a Lonely Planet guidebook, or maybe a popular novel by a local author.</p>
                <h2 class="h2">Useful Travel Packing Tips</h2>
                <h3 class="h3">Pack Less Stuff In Your Backpack</h3>
                <p class="p">7: You don’t need 1/2 the gear you think you do to travel anywhere. We’ve all done it. It’s a right of passage for travelers to slowly become better at packing less.</p>
                <p class="p">As a full-time vagabond, everything I own fits in my travel backpack. If you’re not sure about packing something, you don’t need it. It’s also possible to buy most things at your destination country if you discover you need them.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Bring Good Travel Shoes</h3>
                <p class="p">8: You’re going to be walking a lot when you’re traveling, especially if you want to save money. So invest in a good pair of travel shoes that are lightweight, multi-use, and very comfortable.</p>
                <h2 class="h2">Helpful Travel Safety Tips</h2>
                <h3 class="h3">Don’t Be Afraid Of Other Countries</h3>
                <p class="p">9: The news media loves to report on tourists getting killed or kidnapped. However, the world is not nearly as dangerous as the media makes it out to be. Keep an eye out for sketchy situations but don’t let that be the focus of your whole trip.</p>
                <p class="p">Use common sense and you’ll be ok. Understand that <span style="color: blue">“if it bleeds it leads”</span>. Most people in foreign countries are friendly, trustworthy, generous, and willing to help you out. This goes for women too. </p>
                <h3 class="h3">Always Get Travel Insurance</h3>
                <p class="p">10: No one ever thinks they’ll get sick, injured, or robbed while traveling. But it happens when you least expect it.</p>
                <p class="p">With travel insurance you don’t have to worry about huge hospital bills or stolen gear when it eventually happens. For all kinds of trips ranging from a weekend up to a few months long, we always recommend picking up a travel insurance policy with Safety Wing.</p>
